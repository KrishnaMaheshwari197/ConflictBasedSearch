Conflict-Based Search (CBS) – Multi-Agent Pathfinding

This project implements the Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm to solve optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems on grid maps. Agents must reach their goals without collisions, using a two-level search structure with A* for individual planning and high-level conflict resolution.
